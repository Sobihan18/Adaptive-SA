# Non-asymptotic Analysis of Biased Adaptive Stochastic Approximation

## Overview
This repository contains the code and experiments related to the paper titled "Non-asymptotic Analysis of Biased Adaptive Stochastic Approximation." The paper explores theoretical results in the context of Biased Adaptive Stochastic Approximation, illustrating these results through the application of deep Variational Autoencoders (VAE). It includes implementations of the Importance Weighted Autoencoder (IWAE) using various optimization algorithms, including Adagrad, RMSProp, and Adam, on both the CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets.
